    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reading Material_Gennes LectureFirst, let me quote de Gennes’ short lyric: “Have fun on sea and land Unhappy it is to become famous Riches, honors, false glitters of this world All is but soap bubbles” Pierre-Gilles de Gennes used this poetry to convey his general feeling of the honor of Nobel prize. What fascinates him is the “amusing” science as well as unusual experimental phenomena. In contrast, this unattainable prize for most researchers and accompanying riches, etc. to him are like the soap bubbles. It might be exaggerated, however, after reading this lecture I truly appreciate some of his feelings. This lecture was started by the scientific concept of “soft matter”, then de Gennes shared his understanding. After that de Gennes began to talk about some mechanical properties of dilute coils, surfactants, liquid crystals, ferrosmectic, etc. Last but not least, he also gave some of his viewpoints on the relationship between experiments and theory. Almost all of this lecture was focused on research and science. The “soap bubbles” of this world are not the funny thing to him, but the “amusing” science is. The observation of the conformations of a flexible chain de Gennes mentioned has become the key to later developments in polymer statistics. This really makes me think a lot. In my field, most of the phenomena have been predicted by the fore-distinguished scientist theoretically. At that point, an unusual phenomenon which might not coincide with the previous one needs special attention, which may be a potential breakthrough.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reading Material_1Reading Material_2 Jan D. Achenbach, known for his contributions on the solid mechanics, is a member of US National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering and was honored the Timoshenko Medal, which is the highest award in mechanics community. He has published more than 300 research papers and developed methods for flaw detection and characterization by using contact transducers, imaging techniques, and laser-based ultrasonics. He has been extensively cooperating with investigators from other universities and from industrial organizations on both theoretical and experimental projects.Absolutely, he is a great scientist. What impressed me a lot is that he has cultivated so many distinguished scientists such as L. B. Freund, who is also a Timoshenko Medalist. As far as I know, he also directly or indirectly guided a number of outstanding mechanicians born in China, e. g. Yonggang Huang, Zhigang Suo and Huajian Gao, though I’m not quite sure about this. Indeed, he helped a lot on the higher education and research of China and also contributed a lot in advocating the academic communications of the whole world. I think that he is more of an educationist than just a scientist.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[10月初捣鼓了一两天，有事耽搁就扔在那了，这两天好好看了看hexo和主题的官方文档，稍微顺利一些（网上博客的一些总结很好，但是很多过了时效。）。先配置Hexo的环境，然后同时po到github和codingme，分国内外dns，加载速度要好一些，算是个一劳永逸的活吧。再就是配置next主题的各项配置了，官方文档需要更新了。。。分享页面那里折腾了很久，因为以前的分享方法基本不管用了，最后用的sharesdk。博客的网页是搭好了，真正关键的是内容，希望自己平时能更一些对自己有益对大家有益的东西吧。]]></content>
