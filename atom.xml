    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js"> </script><p><a href="https://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReadingMaterial</a><br>–“Interesting and unpublished” is equivalent to “non-existent”<br>notes after reading Prof. George M. Whitesides’s essay</p><p>Last week, I spent several hours reading this short essay which can be read roughly in only half an hour or less. While reading this paper, I went through my past academic experiences, though it is quite short, and found that once upon a time I was in the situation as George described: I completed my research program and learned from it, which is meaningful enough with or without a research paper or a conclusive report. The statement made by George that “Interesting and unpublished” is equivalent to “non-existent”. This really touches me a lot. </p><p>Similarly, my supervisor told me that whatever you have done and however the significance is, you should draw some conclusions and write some articles. At that time, I did not fully understand it. But now, my viewpoint has changed that all of the work we researchers do like operating analysis, doing experiments, reading papers, etc. are to develop our own ideas and theories to better understand this natural world for mankind and win a better life for ourselves. So they shall not be concealed unintentionally by ourselves but spread and communicated with peers and make some advances in our fields.<br>Also，George made lots of concrete advices on how to write a good scientific paper efficiently, which needs practicing and being carried out in my daily writing tasks. Really useful reading material!</p>]]></content>

    <title>Thoughts after reading Gennes’ Nobel lecture</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<script src="/assets/js/APlayer.min.js"> </script><p><a href="http://p0cjrqf63.bkt.clouddn.com/gennes-lecture.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reading Material_Gennes’ Lecture</a><br>First, let me quote de Gennes’ short lyric:  </p><pre><code>“Have fun on sea and land  Unhappy it is to become famous  Riches, honors, false glitters of this world  All is but soap bubbles”  </code></pre><p>Pierre-Gilles de Gennes used this poetry to convey his general feeling of the honor of Nobel prize. What fascinates him is the “amusing” science as well as unusual experimental phenomena. In contrast, this unattainable prize for most researchers and accompanying riches, etc. to him are like the soap bubbles. It might be exaggerated, however, after reading this lecture I truly appreciate some of his feelings. </p><p>This lecture was started by the scientific concept of “soft matter”, then de Gennes shared his understanding. After that de Gennes began to talk about some mechanical properties of dilute coils, surfactants, liquid crystals, ferrosmectic, etc. Last but not least, he also gave some of his viewpoints on the relationship between experiments and theory. Almost all of this lecture was focused on research and science. The “soap bubbles” of this world are not the funny thing to him, but the “amusing” science is.  </p><p>The observation of the conformations of a flexible chain de Gennes mentioned has become the key to later developments in polymer statistics. This really makes me think a lot. In my field, most of the phenomena have been predicted by the fore-distinguished scientist theoretically. At that point, an unusual phenomenon which might not coincide with the previous one needs special attention, which may be a potential breakthrough.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Thoughts after reading about Jan D. Achenbach</title>

Achenbach, known for his contributions on the solid mechanics, is a member of US National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering and was honored the Timoshenko Medal, which is the highest award in mechanics community. He has published more than 300 research papers and developed methods for flaw detection and characterization by using contact transducers, imaging techniques, and laser-based ultrasonics. He has been extensively cooperating with investigators from other universities and from industrial organizations on both theoretical and experimental projects.<br>Absolutely, he is a great scientist. What impressed me a lot is that he has cultivated so many distinguished scientists such as L. B. Freund, who is also a Timoshenko Medalist. As far as I know, he also directly or indirectly guided a number of outstanding mechanicians born in China, e. g. Yonggang Huang, Zhigang Suo and Huajian Gao, though I’m not quite sure about this. Indeed, he helped a lot on the higher education and research of China and also contributed a lot in advocating the academic communications of the whole world. I think that he is more of an educationist than just a scientist.</p>]]></content>
